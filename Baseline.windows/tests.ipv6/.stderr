warning in C:\Users\Tim\Desktop\projects\zeek2019\scripts\policy\misc/scan.zeek, line 7: deprecated script loaded from C:\Users\Tim\Desktop\projects\zeek2019\scripts\test-all-policy.zeek:83 "Remove in v6.1. Use the external github.com/ncsa/bro-simple-scan package instead (e.g., by installing it via `zkg install ncsa/bro-simple-scan`). The misc/scan.zeek script hasn't been maintained since 2013. Further, the external bro-simple-scan package from NCSA (Justin Azoff) has become the recommended alternative for TCP scan detection."
